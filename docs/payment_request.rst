PaymentRequest
==============

Have a look at the `Payment Request model <https://github.com/bsvetchine/django-pypayzen/blob/master/django_pypayzen/models.py>`_ and at the `Payzen documentation <https://www.payzen.eu/wp-content/uploads/integration/Guide_d_implementation_formulaire_paiement_V2_Payzen_V2.9f.pdf>`_ to see all the parameters that are supported by payzen.

Be careful about the amount parameter ; its value is always a positive integer repesenting the amount in cents.

::

    from django_pypayzen import models as pz_models

    payment_request = pz_models.PaymentRequest(
        amount=1000  # corresponds to 10 â‚¬ if no vads_currency supplied
    )
    payment_request.save()

    payment_request = pz_models.PaymentRequest(
        amount=1000,
        vads_url_success='http://www.loadingdata-band.com/',
        vads_url_refused='http://www.loadingdata-band.com/',
        vads_url_cancel='http://www.loadingdata-band.com/',
        order_id=1,
        order_info="Loading Data c'est d'la boulette",
        order_info2="puis Blues Pills aussi",
        vads_trans_id="000001"
    )
    payment_request.save()
